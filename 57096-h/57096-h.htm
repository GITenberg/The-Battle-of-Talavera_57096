<p>Joseph (el Rey botilla) was in the field, and of course nominally
commanding in chief; but he very prudently placed himself opposite to
the Spanish lines, where there was little to do; and, accordingly, we do
not hear of him again, till his gasconading proclamations from Saint
Olalla, <i>after his retreat</i>.</p>

<p class="c">St. II. l. 5.&mdash;<i>Talavera.</i></p>

<p>Talavera, (called de la Reyna, because it was for some time the
<i>appanage</i> of the Queens of Spain,) is one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> ancient cities
of the monarchy. Though situated nearly in the centre of the Peninsula,
it has had the peculiar ill fortune of suffering in all ages, and from
all parties, the calamities of war. Christians and Moors stormed and
plundered it by turns, and not an instance occurs of an hostile force
failing before it, till that one which I now attempt to describe. The
ramparts were very strong, constructed of immense blocks of free-stone,
and flanked, as it is said, with eighteen square towers; but the most
ancient ramparts and towers have fallen into a state of dilapidation.
The inhabitants themselves, indeed, have been more destructive even than
Time, and, to procure stones for the erection of dwelling-houses, ‘have
industriously pillaged the dismantled walls, and reduced to an
insignificant heap of stones all those stately fragments of majesty and
strength, which had so long been preserved in Talavera as venerable
monuments of its eventful history<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.’</p>

<p>The gate of the western suburb has been rendered memorable by a
flagitious act of cruelty, committed in 1289, at the instigation of
Sancho the Brave. On that spot were exposed to view the dissected limbs
of 400 nobles of Talavera, who had been put to death for their adherence
to the cause of the unfortunate family of La Cerda, against a successful
usurper. This action is yet commemorated in the name of Puerto de
Quartos. Talavera is now a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> and opulent city, and must have
been very populous even in 1289, since it could furnish 400 noble
victims of one party.</p>

<p class="c">St. II. l. 13.&mdash;<i>St. James.</i></p>

<p class="c">St. James, or Saint Jago, is the Patron Saint of Spain. The shrine at
Compostella, on the site of which the Apostle’s body was miraculously
discovered in 800, became famous throughout Europe, and was for many
ages the peculiar object of the liberality of the rich, and of the
pilgrimages of the poor of all nations. In the year 1434, no less than
2460 English had license from the King to proceed thither, with
considerable sums of money, as well for offerings as for their necessary
expenses.</p>

<p>When Almanzor, the Moorish King of Seville, ravaged Gallicia, the divine
interposition preserved, by a miraculous storm of lightning, the temple
of Compostella from plunder and profanation. Is it too much to hope that
the vengeance of Heaven may yet, in our days, visit invaders more
rapacious, more cruel, more impious, than the Moors!</p>

<p class="c">St. III. l. 20.&mdash;<i>Thrice come they on.</i></p>

<p>I have taken the liberty of representing the three attacks on General
Hill’s position to have been all made about midnight, and in immediate
succession, though, in fact, the first occurred late in the evening, the
second only at midnight, and the third about day-break on the 28th.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span></p>

<p>A young and accomplished lady has discovered, as she fancies, a
resemblance between the description of this night-fight, and that of the
encounter of Tancred and Clorinda in the <i>Gierusalemme Liberata</i>. I am
very far from agreeing with my fair critic in this notion, and any of my
readers, who shall turn to the fifty-fourth and subsequent stanzas of
the twelfth canto of the Jerusalem, will have the satisfaction, (not, I
think, of detecting me in a presumptuous and unacknowledged imitation of
Tasso,) but of reading one of the most striking passages of that
splendid poem.</p>

<p class="c">St. VI. l. 23.&mdash;<i>Fifty thousand warriors.</i></p>

<p>The French acknowledge to have had 45,000 men engaged, and we know that
the effective British scarcely, if at all, exceeded 20,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<p>⁂ Since these pages were first published, there have appeared in the
Moniteur of Sept. 28, 1809, notes on Lord Wellington’s dispatches, which
admit the disparity to have been still greater than the most sanguine
Englishman had thought&mdash;than even <i>we romancers</i> had imagined.</p>

<p>They state the army which attacked Lord Wellesley, (as they call him,)
to have consisted of the 1st and 4th corps, and the reserve; and their
force they allege to have been,&mdash;the 1st corps, 36 battalions; the 4th,
30 battalions; and the reserve, 20 battalions, exclusive of the cavalry,
which was 40 squadrons. Now these 86 battalions, if complete, would have
numbered about 60,000 infantry; and even if but <i>half</i> complete, would
have exceeded Lord Wellington’s force, (which they admit to have been
but 20,000) by 10,000 of infantry alone, or, reckoning the cavalry, by
14,000 men. But, in fact, they may be taken at 500 men to each battalion
at least, that is, in the whole, at 43,000 infantry, and about 4,000
cavalry. 1810.</p>

<p>It is now known, that the French force consisted of about 50,000 men.
1812.</p>

<p class="c">St. VIII. l. 6.&mdash;<i>Cold allies.</i></p>

<p>The government and generals of Spain, at the period of the battle of
Talavera, were more than usually tardy and feeble in all their measures.
After the battle, Sir A. Wellesley was disabled from pursuing his
advantages, and (when<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span> he was obliged, by General Cuesta’s extraordinary
conduct, to retreat,) his army was almost exhausted, for want of those
means of transport which the Spanish authorities had liberally promised
him, and which, in fact, they could have furnished in sufficient
abundance. While the guns taken at Talavera were in the possession of
the English, the Spanish General could not be induced to afford the
means of drawing them; but when, on this account, the English were
forced to abandon them, the Spaniards easily found cattle for their
conveyance. So, when the British army laid down its ammunition for want
of means to carry it, the Spaniards found no difficulty in bringing it
away for their own use<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. The correspondence between Sir A. Wellesley,
Lord Wellesley, and M. de Garay, in 1809, afford many similar proofs of
the <i>coldness</i> of the government of our allies; though it is now clear
that it did not exist (as Sir J. Moore seems to have supposed) in all
classes: the lower orders, and not a few of the higher, have all along
exhibited irrefragable proofs of the warmest enthusiasm, and the most
patriotic devotion. There have been, and there still are, a great number
of persons in Spain, who, to say the best of them, are inclined to
<i>temporize</i>; and too many of this class have found means to influence
the national operations.&mdash;In spite of them, however, the spirit of the
people may save their country; and I shall not despair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> however
‘Princes and Lords may flourish or may fade,’ of the cause of Spain,
till ‘the bold peasantry, its country’s pride,’ shall have passed under
the usurper’s yoke.</p>

<p class="c">St. VIII. l. 14.&mdash;<i>The agony of fame.</i></p>

<p>This expression, and another in the last line of the XXVIIth Stanza, are
borrowed from a splendid passage of Mr. Burke’s, in which, speaking of
Lord Keppel, he says, ‘With what zeal and anxious affection I attended
him through his trial, <i>that agony of his glory</i>&mdash;with what prodigality
I <i>squandered</i> myself in courting almost every sort of enmity for his
sake,’ &amp;c. <i>Burke’s Works</i>, v. 8, p. 54.</p>

<p class="c">St. VIII. l. 21.&mdash;<i>Factious spite.</i></p>

<p>The calumniators of Sir Arthur Wellesley have been so industrious in
publishing their malignity, that it is unnecessary to recal to the
public observation any particular instance of it. In reading their base
absurdities, one cannot but recollect the expression of Marshal Villars
(I think it was) to Lewis XIV. ‘Sire, je vais combattre vos ennemis, &amp;
je vous laisse au milieu des miens.’&mdash;Sir Arthur, much worse treated
than M. de Villars, says nothing about it, but beats his country’s
enemies, and despises his own.</p>

<p class="c">St. XIV. l. 1.&mdash;<i>But, tyrant, thou.</i></p>

<p>With all the reluctance which one must feel to charge with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span> atrocious
crimes, a man whose talents (not always ill employed) have raised him to
the highest station and power that any human being ever attained, it is
yet impossible to think of his cruel and unprovoked attack on the
Spanish crown and people without indignation&mdash;without feeling, that
Divine Justice must charge to his account, all the ruin by fire, famine,
and the sword, which his unparalleled injustice has visited upon that
unhappy country.</p>

<p class="c">St. XIV. l. 23.&mdash;<i>The murder’d heir of Bourbon.</i></p>

<p>The seizing the Duke D’Enghien in a neutral state, dragging him to a
tribunal to which he was, in no view, amenable, condemning him by laws
to which he owed no obedience, and finally, putting him to death by a
hasty and cowardly execution by <i>torch-light</i>, are stains on
Buonaparte’s character, of such violence, injustice, and cruelty, as no
good fortune, no talents, no splendour of power, or even of merit, can
ever obliterate.</p>

<p class="c">St. XV. l. 11.&mdash;<i>Spain erect and proud.</i></p>

<p>The author has feared to indulge any very sanguine hope of the final
success of the Spanish cause, particularly since the retreat of the
French from Madrid, and behind the Ebro, was turned to so little solid
advantage by the Spaniards. But that their efforts and their example in
a great degree have already crippled and distracted the power of France,
and afforded a considerable chance for the emancipation of Europe; that
the victories of Baylen and Talavera, the defence of Saragossa and
Gerona, have been of one great advantage (exclusively of any other) in
dissipating the spell of French invincibility, cannot be denied.
Undoubtedly Buonaparte will come out of the Spanish contest, even though
he should finally succeed in placing his brother on the throne, with
diminished reputation and more precarious power. It is singular that in
the succession war, a century ago, the French were obliged in like
manner to retire from Madrid behind the Ebro, and that the negligence of
the other party, in not dislodging them from that position, eventually
placed the French competitor on the throne of Spain. <i>See Carleton’s
Memoirs.</i> 1809.</p>

<p>It is now upwards of two years since this note was written, and it must
be confessed that the French cause is not now, to all appearance, in so
promising a condition as it was then. Hopes that the author once
considered as too sanguine, have been more than realized, and the final
deliverance of Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> from the atrocious usurpation of France, seems
every hour less improbable. 1812.</p>

<p class="c">St. XVII. l. 12.&mdash;<i>Leopards.</i></p>

<p>This is an image which Buonaparte himself has chosen to use: ‘When I
shall shew myself’ (said his speech to the Legislative Body, in Dec.
1809), ‘beyond the Pyrenees, the <i>frightened leopard</i> will fly to the
ocean to avoid shame, defeat, and death.’&mdash;This is bold; what follows
might well be called by the coarser epithet which Doctor Bentley applied
to the imitator of Pindar&mdash;‘The triumph of my arms will be the triumph
of the genius of good over that of evil; of <i>moderation</i>, <i>order</i>, and
<i>morality</i>, over civil war, anarchy, and the bad passions!!! My
friendship and protection will, I hope, restore tranquillity and
happiness to the people of the Spains!!!’</p>

<p class="c">St. XVIII. l. 3.&mdash;<i>Ind’s unequal war.</i></p>

<p>At Assaye, on the third of September, 1803, with 2,000 Europeans, and
2,500 native troops, Sir Arthur Wellesley utterly defeated the united
armies of Scindia and the Rajah of Berar, amounting to 20,000 cavalry,
and at least 11,000 infantry, strongly posted, furnished with a
formidable and well served train of artillery, (all taken,) and
officered in a great degree by Frenchmen. On the 30th Nov. he again came
up with the recruited and reinforced armies of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span> princes in the
plains of Argaum, and again totally routed them, taking thirty-eight
pieces of cannon. Without entering into further detail, it may be enough
to say, that the whole campaign was a master-piece of courage and
conduct, crowned with the most brilliant and decisive successes.</p>

<p class="c">St. XIX. l. 5.&mdash;<i>Of Leon and Castile.</i></p>

<p>The national flag of Spain bears, per pale, Luna, a lion rampant,
Saturn, for Leon; and Mars, a castle, Sol, for Castile.</p>

<p class="c">St. XIX. l. 8.&mdash;<i>To Wellesley’s eyes as pervious as the air.</i></p>

<p>The sagacity with which Sir A. Wellesley always foresaw the enemy’s
point of attack, and prepared means of repelling it, was very
remarkable. Those modest gentlemen in England, who undervalue his
military abilities, are obliged, (though unintentionally I dare say,) to
deny at the same time those of <i>their friends</i> the French, who admit
that the English position was excellently chosen, and obstinately
defended: but indeed this admission was superfluous; for the
perseverance with which they assailed it, sufficiently proves how
important they thought it! Let it never be forgotten, that this
position, five times at least attacked with more than double forces by
some of the best generals and troops of France, was found to be
impregnable. But what are the opinions of the French marshals, or even
the evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span> facts, to the speculations of the tacticians of the
Morning Chronicle.</p>

<p class="c">St. XIX. l. 12.&mdash;<i>Strong covert.</i></p>

<p>‘The right, consisting of Spanish troops, extended immediately in front
of the town of Talavera, down to the Tagus. This part of the ground was
covered by olive-trees, and much intersected by banks and ditches. The
high road leading from the bridge over the Alberche, was defended by a
heavy battery, in front of a church, which was occupied by Spanish
infantry. All the avenues to the town were defended in a similar manner;
the town was occupied, and the remainder of the Spanish infantry was
formed in two lines behind the banks on the roads which led from the
town, and the right to the left of our position.&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Had the French succeeded in carrying that height on which General Hill’s

have stolen: but the first of these faults was unintentional, and I need
scarcely say that the second was inevitable.</p>

<p>General Baron Langworth, (who unfortunately, but gloriously fell,)

considerable service with his corps of Spanish horse, and Generals Payne
and Anson commanded the British cavalry. These troops brought off the
remains of the 23d dragoons, who, in a charge headed by Colonel Seymour,
had gotten entangled in a ravine and deep ditches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span> and were in danger
of being entirely destroyed.&mdash;They behaved with great gallantry, but

<p>The repulse of Victor by the dragoons was followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span> general attack
on the centre and right of the British line, which was every where
gallantly repulsed; but the action was severest towards the left of the
centre, where General Sherbrook commanded: it was there that the gallant
impetuosity of the Guards for a moment endangered the victory, and with
the description of this principal attack the text is chiefly occupied.</p>

<p class="c">St. XXVIII. l. 18.&mdash;<i>The tide of victory turned.</i></p>

<p>It is not to be denied, that at this moment the fate of the day was
something worse than doubtful; but Sir Arthur, as soon as he saw the
advance of the Guards, anticipated the result, and moved other troops
(among the rest the 48th regiment) from the heights into the plain, to
cover the retreat, which took place as he expected.</p>

<p class="c">St. XXVIII. l. last.&mdash;<i>Squanders himself away.</i></p>

<p>See the note in Stanza VII. l. 14.&mdash;Towards the close of the action, Sir

his aid-de-camps were wounded at his side. On this occasion his personal
exertions and peril seemed necessary to retrieve the victory.</p>

French set fire to the field <i>designedly</i>:&mdash;it would rather seem that
the accidental bursting of their shells in the dry grass occasioned this
conflagration, which ravaged a great extent of ground, and entirely
consumed many of the dead, and (horrid to relate!) some of the wounded.
This must have been a new and striking feature of war.</p>

has re-established, in its old and romantic proportion, the relative
scale of British and French prowess; when an achievement, the recital of
which is alone sufficient to shame despondency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> and to give animation

<h2><i>WAR SONG.&mdash;Page 61.</i></h2>

<p>These stanzas were written and published at the breaking out of the
present war, when, it will be recollected, the enemy’s threats of
invasion were not altogether despised in this country. Some of my
readers will possibly observe, that the style and metre of this trifle
are not very dissimilar from those which have been more lately used by
some popular writers. I have therefore thought it necessary to state
that it was published early in 1803&mdash;but the truth is, that the practice
of breaking the regular eight syllable verse into distichs or ternaries,
by shorter lines, is very ancient in English poetry. The Chester
Mysteries, written in 1328, exhibit this metre in a tolerably perfect
state. After a long disuse, it is indebted for its revival and
popularity to the good taste and extraordinary talents of Mr. Scott; and
I cannot but think that it is, in his hands, one of the most harmonious
and delightful of our English measures: to my ear, indeed, the
versification of Marmion, in which Mr. Scott has used this style very
freely, is more agreeable than that of the Lady of the Lake, in which he
has employed it more sparingly. 1812.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span></p>

<h2><i>II.&mdash;SONG OF TRAFALGAR.&mdash;Page 69.</i></h2>

<p class="c">St. III. l. 4.&mdash;<i>Aboukir’s Isle.</i></p>

<p>The western point of Aboukir Bay is formed by an island, now called in
our charts, Nelson’s Island.</p>

<p>On this island probably, and the adjoining peninsula, stood the ancient
Canopus, both being, to this day, covered with ruins, supposed to be
those of that celebrated city.</p>

<p>This, I am inclined to think, is the Canopic Island known to all
antiquity, and in later times called the Island Aboukir. (Eutychius,
Ann. 2. 508.) This would account for the testimony given by Pliny,
Strabo, &amp;c. as to the insular situation of Canopus, and by Scylax, as to
an island in the Canopic mouth, without having recourse to the
supposition that the Isthmus, somewhere between Alexandria and Aboukir
castle, had been covered by the sea, which indeed seems rather to have
encroached upon, than receded from, that part of the coast.</p>

<p class="c">St. III. l. 7.&mdash;<i>St. Vincent’s towery steep.</i></p>

<p>On the summit of St. Vincent’s, and close on the precipices which
overhang the sea, is a convent, which gives the name of its patron to
the Cape.</p>

<h2><i>III.&mdash;SONG OF TRAFALGAR.&mdash;Page 73.</i></h2>

<p class="c">St. II. l. 3.&mdash;<i>Twenty hostile ensigns low.</i></p>

<p>Such was the statement of the London Gazette, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span> 27th Nov. 1805;
but in a subsequent number this was noticed as an error, there being, in
fact, <i>but nineteen</i> sail of the line taken or utterly destroyed. I have
been assured by a gentleman who was at that period in Germany, that this
instance of the scrupulous veracity of the British government produced
an effect little less favourable to the British character than the news
of the victory itself.</p>

<p>I hope, however, that I may be forgiven for adhering to the first
report, particularly as these lines were written on the day I first
heard of the battle, and before the corrected statement came to my
knowledge.</p>

<p>It was a striking proof of Lord Nelson’s almost miraculous sagacity,
that just at the commencement of the action, he expressed his opinion
that twenty sail of the enemy would be taken.</p>

<p>These lines were written before the intentions of government as to the
hero’s funeral were known, or probably had been fixed; but I could not
refrain from expressing my hope that the usual cold and penurious
ceremonies should not disgrace an occasion so infinitely removed from,
and above all precedent; or that the grief of the navy and the nation
should be directed by chapter and section, and attested by twenty-five
minute-guns, and <i>no more</i>! After all, the funeral did no great credit
to our national taste; and I could wish, that the only memorial of it
which remains, I mean the pitiful and trumpery car on which the body was
carried, were returned from the Painted Hall at Greenwich, which it
disgraces, to the repository of the undertaker who built it. Shabby and
tasteless as it originally was, it is now much worse; for whatever was
costly about it has been removed, (particularly the plumes,) and cheap
<i>second hand</i> finery substituted instead. To this almost incredible
meanness is added that of shewing this wretched vamped-up vehicle to the
visitors at Greenwich at <i>threepence</i> each!!!</p>

<p>The famous pillar, commonly called Pompey’s, but stated, with such
ostentation of accuracy by all the French sçavans, to have been erected
in honour of Septimius Severus. The ingenuity and industry, however, of
two British officers, Capt. Duncan, of the royal engineers, and Lieut.
De Sade, of the Queen’s German regiment, have recovered the inscription
on this celebrated column, which attests that it was erected and
dedicated to Diocletian by Pontius, prefect of Egypt.</p>

<p>Line 49.&mdash;<i>Thither shall youthful heroes climb.</i></p>

<p>This and some other passages, (in these songs of Trafalgar,) so much
resemble some thoughts in the vigorous and beautiful verses entitled,
‘Ulm and Trafalgar,’ that it is necessary for me to say that the former
were written and published in Ireland in Nov. 1805, and that it was not
until a very considerable time after, that I had the pleasure of reading
the latter, which were printed in London early, I believe, in 1806. I
should also add, that I think it highly improbable that my little
publication could have reached the author of ‘Ulm and Trafalgar,’ before
his poem appeared: so that whatever coincidence there may be is purely
accidental. I cannot but confess that I have thought much the better of
my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span> lines since I have discovered them to have any resemblance to
his, though I am aware that upon every body else a contrary effect will
be produced, and that nothing can be more unfavourable to me than any
thing like a comparison between us.</p>

</div>

<p>These verses were prompted by the indignation which I felt and feel at
the <i>unbritish</i> language of those who tremble, or affect to tremble, for
the safety of England, who prophesy the subjugation of Spain, and
trumpet forth the invincibility of Bonaparte. It may be weakness, it may
be ignorance, which prompts such expressions;&mdash;it may be a sincere,
though shameful conviction of the vanity of opposing France;&mdash;but,
whatever be its source, such conduct appears to be a most potent
auxiliary to the common enemy of Europe, and very little short of
treason against the liberties of mankind. 1810.</p>

<p class="c">Line 16.&mdash;<i>Saragossa.</i></p>

<p>The defence of this city, in 1809, by its gallant inhabitants, under
their heroic leader, Don Josef Palafox, is one of the most splendid and
extraordinary events of modern times; and if any one of my readers shall
not have seen the narrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span> of the siege published by Mr. Vaughan, I
cannot (though the subject is, in some degree, gone by) but recommend it
to his perusal, as a valuable record ‘of an event which teaches so
forcibly the resources of patriotism and courage;’ and of an example
which ought not to be lost to the world.</p>

<p class="c">Line 17.&mdash;<i>Heroes and saints.</i></p>

<p>‘One character which developed itself during the siege of Zaragoza, must
not be overlooked in this narrative. In every part of the town where the
danger was most imminent, and the French the most numerous, was Padre
St. Jago Sass, curate of a parish of Zaragoza. As General Palafox made
his rounds through the city, he often beheld Sass alternately playing
the part of a priest and a soldier; sometimes administering the
sacrament to the dying, and at others fighting in the most determined
manner against the enemies of his country: from his energy of character
and uncommon bravery, the Commander in Chief reposed the utmost
confidence in him during the siege; wherever any thing difficult or
hazardous was to be done, Sass was selected for its execution; and the
introduction of a supply of powder, so essentially necessary to the
defence of the town, was effected in the most complete manner by this
clergyman, at the head of forty of the bravest men in Zaragoza. He was
found so serviceable in inspiring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span> people with religious sentiments,
and in leading them on to danger, that the general has placed him in a
situation where both his piety and courage may continue to be as useful
as before; and he is now both captain in the army, and chaplain to the
Commander in Chief.’</p>

<p>The characteristic obstinacy of Napoleon was never more fully displayed
than in what we may be permitted to hope will prove the last of his
fields. He would listen to no advice, and allow of no obstacles. An
eye-witness has given the following account of his demeanour towards the
end of the action:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was near seven o’clock; Buonaparte, who, till then, had remained
upon the ridge of the hill whence he could best behold what passed,
contemplated, with a stern countenance, the scene of this horrible
slaughter. The more that obstacles seemed to multiply, the more his
obstinacy seemed to increase. He became indignant at these unforeseen
difficulties; and, far from fearing to push to extremities an army whose
confidence in him was boundless, he ceased not to pour down fresh
troops, and to give orders to march forward&mdash;to charge with the
bayonet&mdash;to carry by storm. He was repeatedly informed, from different
points, that the day went against him, and that the troops seemed to be
disordered; to which he only replied,&mdash;‘<i>En avant! en avant!</i>’</p>

<p>“One general sent to inform the Emperor that he was in a position which
he could not maintain, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span> it was commanded by a battery, and
requested to know, at the same time, in what way he should protect his
division from the murderous fire of the English artillery. ‘Let him
storm the battery,’ replied Buonaparte, and turned his back on the
aid-de-camp who brought the message.”&mdash;<i>Relation de la Bataille de
Mont-Saint-Jean. Par un Temoin Occulaire.</i> Paris, 1815, 8vo. p. 51.</p>

<p class="c">Note IV.</p>

<p class="c">
<i>The fate their leader shunn’d to share.</i>&mdash;<a href="#page_205">P. 205.</a><br />
</p>

<p>It has been reported that Buonaparte charged at the head of his guards
at the last period of this dreadful conflict. This, however, is not
accurate. He came down, indeed, to a hollow part of the high road
leading to Charleroi, within less than a quarter of a mile of the farm
of La Haye Sainte, one of the points most fiercely disputed. Here he
harangued the guards, and informed them that his preceding operations
had destroyed the British infantry and cavalry, and that they had only
to support the fire of the artillery, which they were to attack with the
bayonet. This exhortation was received with shouts of <i>Vive l’Empereur</i>,
which were heard over all our line, and led to an idea that Napoleon was
charging in person. But the guards were led on by Ney; nor did
Buonaparte approach nearer the scene of action than the spot already
mentioned, which the rising banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span> on each side rendered secure from all
such balls as did not come in a straight line. He witnessed the earlier
part of the battle from places yet more remote, particularly from an
observatory which had been placed there by the king of the Netherlands,
some weeks before, for the purpose of surveying the country.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is
not meant to infer from these particulars that Napoleon shewed, on that
memorable occasion, the least deficiency in personal courage; on the
contrary, he evinced the greatest composure and presence of mind during
the whole action. But it is no less true that report has erred in
ascribing to him any desperate efforts of valour for recovery of the
battle; and it is remarkable, that during the whole carnage, none of his
suite were either killed or wounded, whereas scarcely one of the Duke of
Wellington’s personal attendants escaped unhurt.</p>

<p class="c">
<i>England shall tell the fight.</i>&mdash;<a href="#page_205">P. 205.</a><br />
</p>

<p>In riding up to a regiment which was hard pressed, the Duke called to
the men, “Soldiers, we must never<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span> be beat,&mdash;what will they say in
England?” It is needless to say how this appeal was answered.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>A private soldier of the 95th regiment compared the sound which took
place immediately upon the British cavalry mingling with those of the
enemy, to “<i>a thousand tinkers at work mending pots and kettles</i>.”</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>No persuasion or authority could prevail upon the French troops to stand
the shock of the bayonet. The imperial guards, in particular, hardly
stood till the British were within thirty yards of them, although the
French author, already quoted, has put into their mouths the magnanimous
sentiment, “The guards never yield&mdash;they die.” The same author has
covered the plateau, or eminence, of St Jean, which formed the British
position, with redoubts and entrenchments which never had an existence.
As the narrative, which is in many respects curious, was written by an
eye-witness, he was probably deceived by the appearance of a road and
ditch<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span> which runs along part of the hill. It may be also mentioned, in
criticising this work, that the writer states the Chateau of Hougomont
to have been carried by the French, although it was resolutely and
successfully defended during the whole action. The enemy, indeed,
possessed themselves of the wood by which it is surrounded, and at
length set fire to the house itself; but the British (a detachment of
the Guards, under the command of Colonel Macdonnell, and afterwards of
Colonel Home,) made good the garden, and thus preserved, by their
desperate resistance, the post which covered the return of the Duke of
Wellington’s right flank.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
